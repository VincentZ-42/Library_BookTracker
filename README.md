## Objectives
-  Implement library to track read and unread books using HTML, CSS, n JavaScript
-  Learn to use LocalStorage to store data input from User

## Thoughts
- This was more challenging than I had anticipated. I struggled mostly with customizing the display of all the elements in CSS and organizaing everything in HTML. 
- For future features, I would like to add links to  the books, verify the inputs, and improve upon the look and layout of this webpage.
